# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

During the software development process, I’ll interpret user needs and implement them into a program. First, I’ll collect information about the user's needs, requirements, and expectations via interviews, surveys, focus groups, etc. Then I’ll create a plan for how the program will meet the user's needs. Next, I will write the code necessary to realize the program's features and functions. Once the code is written, I’ll test the program to ensure it meets the user's requirements and functions as intended. Even after the program is released, I’ll continue to maintain and improve it over time. So, I will have to work closely with stakeholders, including end-users, project managers, and other members of the agile team to ensure that the program meets the user's needs and functions as intended.

Creating user stories is a common practice used in software development. It helps developers to understand what the user needs to accomplish and prioritize features/functionality based on their significance to the user. It also provides a common language for the development team and stakeholders to communicate about the program's features/functionality. Finally, user stories can be used as the basis for testing the program.
